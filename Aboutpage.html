            My name is Chukwuma Ilodibe,and I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business pursuing a degree in management information systems and applying for the accelerated Masters in Information Technology. I am originally from Nigeria but I completed my high school at UWC Costa Rica and am currently studying in the US.
            Professionally, I am interested in the Business Tech industry hence my major. I am actively working toward a role or something along those lines that allow me to use the ability to provide services and assist clients/users with tech interfaces or advance their business with emerging technology. 
            On the flip side, my hobbies include playing soccer, basketball, and video games. I am part of the OU men’s soccer club and play twice a week. 
            Also, I am a member of the OU Rotaract club where we volunteer in and around Norman, and I am also an International Freshman peer mentor. 
            A fun fact about me is that I have lived in 3 different countries as I am originally from Nigeria, attended two years of high school In Costa Rica, and currently schooling in the US.
